# odin-mastermind
A little game based off of mastermind created for The Odin Project

You have the option of either being the code maker or the code breaker. As code maker you can face one of two opponents, the "Easy" opponent receives direct input as to which peg is returning which result. The "Hard" opponent is inspired by, but not equal to, Donald Knuths algorithm.
